# Redis Connection and Flask Context Fix

## Issue Summary

We encountered an error in the Redis health check endpoint registration:
```
ERROR:redis-patch:Could not add Redis health check endpoint: Working outside of application context.
```

This was happening because the code was trying to use Flask's `current_app` outside of an application context. When the Redis patch was being applied, it was attempting to register a Flask route (the `/admin/redis_ping` endpoint) without proper context.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Modified Redis Connection Patch

In `redis_connection_patch.py`, we:
- Moved `register_redis_ping_endpoint` to be a top-level function instead of nested
- Removed code that tried to directly access `current_app`
- Updated `apply_all_patches()` to use the top-level function directly

### 2. Improved Flask Context Handling

In `app.py`, we:
- Added an explicit `app.app_context()` block when setting up Redis
- Ensured Redis connection is properly initialized within the context
- Stored the Redis connection in the app config for the endpoint to access

### 3. Added Testing Tools

- Created `test_redis_context.py` to test the Flask context fix
- Created `verify_redis_endpoint.sh` to verify the Redis health check endpoint works

## Expected Behavior

After these changes, the Redis health check endpoint should work properly:
- No more "Working outside of application context" errors
- The `/admin/redis_ping` endpoint should be available and return Redis status
- The Redis connection should be properly initialized and stored in the Flask app

## Testing

You can verify the fix with:

```bash
./verify_redis_endpoint.sh [service_url]
```

This script will test if the Redis health check endpoint responds correctly.

## Deployment

The fix should be deployed using the normal deployment process to make it effective.
