# SHAP Microservice Deployment & Worker Fix: Final Steps

## Deployment Process

Follow these steps to complete the deployment of the SHAP microservice to Render.com with all fixes applied:

1. **Apply Worker Name Collision Fix**:
   ```bash
   ./fix_worker_name_collision.sh
   ```
   This will update the worker script to use unique names and clean up stale registrations.

2. **Execute Final Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_to_render_final.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Verify all required files
   - Apply the worker name collision fix
   - Create necessary model files
   - Set optimized environment variables
   - Prepare the deployment package
   - Guide you through deployment options

3. **Monitor the Deployment**:
   - Watch the build logs in the Render dashboard
   - Verify that both web and worker services build successfully
   - Check for any errors during startup

4. **Verify the Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./verify_render_deployment.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Check if the service is responding
   - Verify Redis connection
   - Check worker status via the `/worker-status` endpoint
   - Monitor memory usage

## Key Optimizations Applied

1. **Memory Optimizations**:
   - Increased memory threshold from 450MB to 475MB
   - Disabled aggressive memory management
   - Increased batch size from 300 to 500 rows

2. **Redis Connection Stability**:
   - Enhanced connection handling with better error recovery
   - Added socket keepalive settings
   - Improved timeout and retry mechanisms

3. **Worker Process Enhancements**:
   - Fixed worker name collision issues
   - Implemented retry logic for worker startup
   - Added stale worker cleanup
   - Updated worker naming scheme to ensure uniqueness

4. **Monitoring Improvements**:
   - Added `/worker-status` endpoint
   - Enhanced memory stats reporting
   - Implemented Redis health checks

## Post-Deployment Checks

After deploying, verify the following:

1. **Worker Status**: Check `/worker-status` to ensure workers are active
2. **Job Processing**: Submit a test job and verify it completes
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor `/memory-stats` to ensure usage stays under 512MB
4. **Redis Stability**: Check `/redis-check` for connection health

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Worker Name Collisions**:
   - Check logs for "Worker already exists" errors
   - Restart the worker service in Render dashboard
   - Apply the worker name collision fix if needed

2. **Memory Issues**:
   - Reduce batch size in environment variables
   - Enable aggressive memory management if needed
   - Consider vertical scaling in Render dashboard

3. **Redis Connection Issues**:
   - Increase timeout values
   - Check Redis URL in environment variables
   - Verify Redis instance is running correctly
