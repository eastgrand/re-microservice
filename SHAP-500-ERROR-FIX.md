# SHAP Microservice 500 Error Fix

**Date:** May 15, 2025  
**Issue:** HTTP 500 errors during SHAP analysis with jobs getting stuck in "started" state

## Problem Diagnosed

After careful analysis of application logs and code, we identified several critical issues causing the 500 errors in the SHAP microservice:

1. **Memory Management Issues**: SHAP analysis was consuming too much memory when processing datasets, causing worker processes to be terminated by Render's memory limits.

2. **Worker Process Configuration**: RQ worker settings weren't optimized for Render's environment, leading to workers starting jobs but failing to complete them.

3. **SHAP Processing Limitations**: Large datasets were being processed all at once, overwhelming the available memory and causing worker crashes.

4. **Redis Connection Management**: While the Redis connection patches fixed the initial connection issues, worker processes were still experiencing Redis timeouts during lengthy SHAP calculations.

## Solution Implemented

We've created a comprehensive fix that addresses all these issues:

### 1. Memory-Optimized SHAP Processing (`shap_memory_fix.py`)

- Implements batched/chunked SHAP value calculations to process larger datasets without memory spikes
- Adds aggressive garbage collection at key points to free memory during processing
- Optimizes data handling to reduce memory footprint
- Provides enhanced error handling with memory usage reporting

### 2. Worker Process Improvements

- Updates worker process with better monitoring and cleanup capabilities
- Implements a job repair utility to recover stuck jobs
- Configures worker to run in "burst" mode for better cleanup on shutdown
- Adds memory monitoring endpoint for real-time diagnostics

### 3. Render Configuration Updates

- Updates `render.yaml` with optimal memory settings
- Adds environment variables to control optimization behavior
- Improves worker startup sequence for better reliability
- Ensures proper Redis connection parameters

### 4. Monitoring and Diagnostics

- Adds `/admin/memory` endpoint to monitor memory usage
- Creates diagnostic scripts for troubleshooting
- Implements verification tools to confirm fix is working

## How to Deploy

1. Run the comprehensive fix deployment script:

```bash
./deploy_comprehensive_fix.sh
```

2. Push changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

3. Deploy to Render (automatically or manually from the dashboard)

4. Verify the fix is working:

```bash
python verify_shap_fix.py
```

## Further Customization

The memory optimization can be tuned with these environment variables:

- `AGGRESSIVE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT` (default: true): Enables additional memory optimizations
- `SHAP_BATCH_SIZE` (default: 500): Maximum rows to process in a single SHAP batch
- `REDIS_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` (default: 30): Seconds between Redis connection health checks

## Technical Details

### SHAP Memory Optimization

The memory usage spike during SHAP value calculation is resolved by processing the dataset in smaller chunks:

```python
# Instead of calculating all SHAP values at once:
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer(X)  # Memory spike!

# We now use chunked processing:
all_shap_values = []
for chunk in chunks:
    explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
    chunk_values = explainer(chunk)
    all_shap_values.append(chunk_values.values)
    # Release memory
    del explainer
    del chunk_values
    gc.collect()
```

### Worker Process Monitoring

The worker process now tracks its memory usage and job processing durations, making it easier to identify performance issues:

```python
@app.route('/admin/memory', methods=['GET'])
def memory_status():
    # Returns current memory usage and optimization status
```

## Verification

After deployment, you should see:

1. Jobs move from "started" to "finished" state consistently
2. No more HTTP 500 errors from the `/analyze` endpoint
3. Memory usage remaining stable during SHAP calculations

## Support

If you encounter any issues with this fix:

1. Check application logs for specific error messages
2. Run the diagnostic scripts to identify the problem
3. Adjust memory optimization parameters as needed
