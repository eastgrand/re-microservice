# SHAP Microservice Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. SHAP Import Issues
- **Pyspark Import Error**: Fixed missing `pyspark = None` fallback in _tree.py
- **Catboost Import Error**: Improved with try/except pattern and flag-based checks

### 2. NumPy API Compatibility
- **bool8 Deprecation**: Updated deprecated `np.bool8` references to `np.bool_` 
- **obj2sctype Deprecation**: Replaced `np.obj2sctype()` with `np.dtype().type` pattern

### 3. Type Checking
- Created pyrightconfig.json to exclude SHAP library from type checking
- Prevents IDE errors while allowing the service to run correctly

## Tools and Scripts Created

### Verification Tools
- `verify_shap.py`: Tests basic SHAP functionality with XGBoost
- `verify_shap_xgboost.py`: Tests SHAP with actual project models
- `test_numpy_api.py`: Checks NumPy API compatibility
- `find_deprecated_apis.py`: Searches for deprecated NumPy APIs

### Patching Tools
- `patch_shap_library.py`: Comprehensive patching script
- `direct_shap_patch.py`: Direct patching approach
- `patch_shap_imports.py`: Focused on import fixes
- `disable_shap_typecheck.py`: Creates PyRight config

## Documentation
- `SHAP-PATCHES.md`: Detailed documentation of all patches
- Updated README.md with patch information
- Code comments in patching scripts

## Future Maintenance

To maintain compatibility with future Python and NumPy versions:

1. **When updating SHAP**: Re-apply the patches or verify if upstream has fixed the issues
2. **When updating NumPy**: Check for new deprecations that might affect SHAP
3. **When updating Python**: Test the microservice thoroughly with the new Python version

Regular testing with the verification scripts will help identify any new issues early.

## Conclusion

The SHAP microservice should now work correctly with Python 3.13 and newer NumPy versions. All critical import and API compatibility issues have been addressed with minimal changes to the library code. The applied patches are non-invasive and focused on maintaining compatibility without changing core functionality.
