# Field Mapping Update Completion

## Summary

The field mapping enhancement project has been successfully completed. All fields from the `nesto_merge_0.csv` are now properly mapped to standardized names in the field mapping definition, with particular focus on percentage fields which are more valuable for analysis.

## Accomplishments

1. **Comprehensive Field Mapping**
   - All 134 columns from the original CSV have been mapped to 136 standardized field names (including derived fields)
   - Organized fields into logical categories (Geographic, Demographic, Housing, Economic)
   - Followed consistent naming conventions, including `_Pct` suffix for percentage fields

2. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Updated `NESTO_FIELD_MAPPING.md` with comprehensive documentation of all fields
   - Organized fields into clear categories with descriptions
   - Preserved the explanation about the importance of percentage fields for analysis

3. **Sample Data Generation**
   - Updated `setup_for_render.py` to generate realistic sample data for all fields
   - Fixed the missing import issue (`subprocess`)
   - Ensured proper generation of sample data for all new mapped fields

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Successfully ran the setup script which:
     - Generates sample data for all fields
     - Applies the field mapping correctly
     - Creates a proper cleaned data file
     - Trains the model with the expanded feature set

## Field Categories

The mappings now include comprehensive fields across these categories:

1. **Geographic Information**
   - FSA codes, province codes, geographic dimensions

2. **Demographic Data**
   - Population counts and percentages by gender, age groups, and visible minority status
   - Marital status data (married, single, divorced, common law, etc.)

3. **Housing Information**
   - Housing types and counts (single detached, apartments, condos, etc.)
   - Housing age/construction period
   - Tenure information (owned vs. rented)
   - Housing costs (mortgage payments, property taxes, condo fees)

4. **Economic Indicators**
   - Income metrics (average, median, aggregate, discretionary, disposable)
   - Employment data (participation rate, employment rate, unemployment rate)
   - Financial services usage
   - Population and income change projections

5. **Mortgage Data**
   - Application counts
   - Approval rates

## Performance Considerations

During testing, we noticed some performance warnings about DataFrame fragmentation in the mapping process. A future enhancement could involve refactoring the mapping implementation to use pandas.concat with all columns at once for better performance.

## Conclusion

The field mapping has been successfully updated to include ALL fields from the source data, with proper standardization and documentation. The percentage fields have been properly identified for use in analysis tasks like correlation and regression. The entire pipeline is functioning correctly from data ingestion through model training.
