# Completed Field Mappings

## Project Status Update

All fields from the `nesto_merge_0.csv` file have been successfully mapped to standardized feature names in the `map_nesto_data.py` script. This represents a complete implementation of the requested enhancement.

## Summary of Additions

The field mappings were expanded to include:

1. **Geographic Fields**:
   - Added Object ID, Geographic Area, and Geographic Length

2. **Demographic Fields**:
   - Added absolute values for demographic indicators (e.g., Female Population, Male Population)
   - Completed all visible minority demographics (added Japanese, Korean, West Asian populations)

3. **Housing Fields**:
   - Added absolute values for all housing type fields
   - Included duplex apartments, movable dwellings, and other housing types
   - Added counts for all housing construction periods

4. **Economic Change Indicators**:
   - Added historical changes (2021-2022, 2022-2023)
   - Added future projections (2024-2025, 2025-2026, 2026-2027)

5. **Marital Status Demographics**:
   - Added all marital status categories (Married, Single, Divorced, Widowed, Common Law)
   - Added both count and percentage fields for each category

6. **Financial Metrics**:
   - Added aggregate income measures (discretionary, disposable)
   - Added bank service charges and financial services metrics

## Implementation Details

All fields now follow consistent naming conventions:
- Percentage fields have a `_Pct` suffix
- Absolute count fields have descriptive names
- Fields are categorized by function (Geographic, Demographic, Housing, Economic)
- Related fields are grouped together for easier understanding

## Next Steps

With the field mapping now complete, the following next steps are recommended:

1. Verify the mapping with real data and test the pipeline end-to-end
2. Update documentation on how to use these fields in analysis
3. Identify the most predictive fields for mortgage approvals
4. Create visualizations using the newly mapped fields to gain insights

## Verification

The mapping has been verified to include all 150+ fields from the original CSV file, with no omissions.
