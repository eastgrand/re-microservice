# SHAP Redis Connection Fix - Summary

## Issue

The SHAP microservice was experiencing Redis connection issues that caused:
- Worker processes failing to process jobs
- Jobs getting stuck in the "started" state indefinitely
- Timeouts in the service's health check endpoints
- Redis connection failures during peak usage

## Solution

We implemented comprehensive Redis connection improvements:

1. **Enhanced Connection Handling**
   - Added connection pooling (configurable pool size)
   - Set appropriate timeouts for all Redis operations
   - Implemented automatic reconnection
   - Added health check endpoint specifically for Redis

2. **Client-Side Improvements**
   - Added timeout protection for all API calls
   - Enhanced health checking with Redis status reporting
   - Improved job monitoring with stalled job detection
   - Added job recovery mechanism for interrupted processes

3. **Configuration Options**
   - `REDIS_TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout in seconds
   - `REDIS_SOCKET_KEEPALIVE`: TCP keepalive for long-lived connections
   - `REDIS_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE`: Number of connections in the pool
   - `AGGRESSIVE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT`: Enable memory optimizations

## Deployment

The fix has been successfully deployed to both the SHAP microservice and the client application:

- The Redis connection patch is in `redis_connection_patch.py`
- App configuration updates are in `app.py` and `.env`
- Client integration is in `shapClientEnhanced.ts`

## Verification

The Redis connection improvements can be verified using:

- `verify_redis_bash.sh` in the SHAP microservice
- `verify-shap-connection.mjs` in the client app
- `integration-test.mjs` for full end-to-end testing
