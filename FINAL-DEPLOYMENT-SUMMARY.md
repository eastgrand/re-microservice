# SHAP Microservice Deployment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the deployment of the optimized SHAP microservice to Render.com, including the resolution of the worker name collision issue that occurred during deployment.

## Timeline

- **May 15, 2025**: Initial deployment attempt encountered worker name collision issue
- **May 16, 2025**: Fixed worker name collision and successfully deployed optimized service

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Memory Usage Optimizations
- ✅ Increased memory threshold from 450MB to 475MB
- ✅ Disabled aggressive memory management for the worker
- ✅ Increased batch size from 300 to 500 rows
- ✅ Improved memory management in `optimize_memory.py`

### 2. Redis Connection Stability
- ✅ Enhanced Redis connection handling with better error recovery
- ✅ Added socket keepalive settings to prevent timeouts
- ✅ Improved timeout and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Removed dependency on problematic `Connection` class

### 3. Worker Process Enhancements
- ✅ Updated worker configuration to use `simple_worker.py`
- ✅ Fixed worker script issues causing jobs to get stuck
- ✅ Implemented unique worker naming with retry logic
- ✅ Added stale worker cleanup functionality

### 4. Model File Handling
- ✅ Improved `create_minimal_model.py` for fallback model creation
- ✅ Added verification to ensure model files exist before deployment
- ✅ Fixed warning about model files not found during skipped training

## Key Files Created/Modified

1. **Worker Improvements**:
   - `simple_worker.py` - Enhanced worker script with unique naming and retry logic
   - `fix_worker_name_collision.sh` - Script to apply worker name collision fix

2. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - `deploy_to_render_final.sh` - Comprehensive deployment script
   - `verify_render_deployment.sh` - Post-deployment verification script
   - `render_pre_deploy.sh` - Pre-deployment checks script

3. **Configuration**:
   - `render.yaml` - Updated with optimized settings and unique worker name
   - `optimize_memory.py` - Improved memory management settings

4. **Documentation**:
   - `WORKER-COLLISION-RESOLUTION.md` - Details of worker name collision fix
   - `DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md` - Guide for verifying deployment
   - `RENDER-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Updated deployment instructions

## Resolution of Worker Name Collision Issue

### Problem
Worker failed to start with error: `ValueError: There exists an active worker named 'simple-worker-65' already`

### Root Cause
- Worker name was based solely on process ID (PID)
- When Render restarted containers, the same PID was reused
- Redis still had registration for previous worker with the same name

### Solution
1. **Unique Worker Names**: Combined hostname, PID, timestamp, and UUID
2. **Stale Worker Cleanup**: Added function to clean up stale worker registrations
3. **Retry Logic**: Implemented retry with new unique name when collision detected
4. **Service Name Uniqueness**: Added timestamp to worker service name in render.yaml

## Deployment Configuration

### Web Service
- **Plan**: Starter (512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION`: true
  - `MAX_MEMORY_MB`: 475
  - `AGGRESSIVE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT`: false (for web service)
  - `SHAP_MAX_BATCH_SIZE`: 500

### Worker Service
- **Plan**: Starter (512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU)
- **Name**: nesto-mortgage-analytics-worker-05162025 (with timestamp)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION`: true
  - `MAX_MEMORY_MB`: 475
  - `AGGRESSIVE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT`: false
  - `SHAP_MAX_BATCH_SIZE`: 500
  - `REDIS_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`: 30
  - `REDIS_SOCKET_KEEPALIVE`: true
  - `REDIS_TIMEOUT`: 10

## Redis Configuration

- **Connection Settings**:
  - Socket timeout: 10 seconds
  - Socket keepalive: Enabled
  - Health check interval: 30 seconds
  - Retry on timeout: Enabled

## Verification Steps

1. **Deployment Status**: Both web service and worker show as "Live"
2. **Worker Startup**: Logs show successful worker registration without name collision
3. **Redis Connection**: Health check endpoint confirms stable connection
4. **Job Processing**: Test job completes successfully
5. **Memory Usage**: Stays below 512MB limit
6. **Multiple Restarts**: Worker restarts successfully without name collision errors

## Next Steps

1. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Regular check of memory usage metrics
   - Monitor job processing times with increased batch size
   - Watch for any Redis connection issues

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Consider adding scheduled task for Redis cleanup
   - Implement automated health checks
   - Explore further memory optimizations if needed
