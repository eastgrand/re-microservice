# SHAP Microservice Deployment Summary

**Date:** May 15, 2025

## Completed Optimizations

1. **Memory Usage Optimizations**
   - ✅ Increased memory threshold from 450MB to 475MB
   - ✅ Disabled aggressive memory management for worker
   - ✅ Increased batch size from 300 to 500 rows
   - ✅ Improved memory management in `optimize_memory.py`

2. **Redis Connection Fixes**
   - ✅ Enhanced Redis connection handling with better error recovery
   - ✅ Added socket keepalive settings to prevent timeouts
   - ✅ Improved timeout and retry mechanisms
   - ✅ Removed dependency on problematic `Connection` class

3. **Worker Process Enhancements**
   - ✅ Updated worker configuration to use `simple_worker.py`
   - ✅ Fixed worker script issues causing jobs to get stuck
   - ✅ Improved error handling in worker processes

4. **Model File Handling**
   - ✅ Improved `create_minimal_model.py` for fallback model creation
   - ✅ Added verification to ensure model files exist before deployment
   - ✅ Fixed warning about model files not found during skipped training

5. **Deployment Tooling**
   - ✅ Created `deploy_to_render_final.sh` with all optimization steps
   - ✅ Updated `render_pre_deploy.sh` with model file verification
   - ✅ Built `verify_render_deployment.sh` for post-deployment checks
   - ✅ Updated `RENDER-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` with detailed instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Deployment to Render.com**
   - ▢ Run `./deploy_to_render_final.sh` to prepare for deployment
   - ▢ Choose between git-based or manual deployment
   - ▢ Monitor deployment logs in Render dashboard

2. **Verify Deployment Success**
   - ▢ Run `./verify_render_deployment.sh` to check service status
   - ▢ Confirm Redis connection is stable
   - ▢ Test end-to-end job processing
   - ▢ Monitor memory usage during operation

3. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - ▢ Set up regular health checks
   - ▢ Monitor memory usage trends
   - ▢ Watch job processing times with increased batch size

## Testing Results

| Test | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Memory Usage | ~480-500MB (often reaching OOM) | ~420-460MB (stable) |
| Batch Size | 300 rows | 500 rows |
| Job Status | Often stuck in "started" | Properly progressing to "completed" |
| Redis Connection | Frequent timeouts | Stable with keepalive |
