# This module originally held the full data-mapping logic for the NESTO dataset
# (MASTER_SCHEMA, data loaders, etc.).  During recent refactors it was replaced
# with an empty placeholder which breaks the import in app.py during deploy
# (ImportError: cannot import name 'MASTER_SCHEMA').
#
# To restore compatibility – and unblock deployments – we provide *minimal*
# stub implementations that satisfy the expected interface.  They can be
# replaced with the full logic once it is re-integrated.
