# SHAP Memory Optimization Fix

**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Issue:** HTTP 500 errors during SHAP analysis with jobs stuck in "started" state

## Diagnosis

After analyzing the application logs and code, we identified several issues:

1. **Memory Usage:** SHAP calculations were using too much memory when processing large datasets
2. **Worker Process:** The RQ worker process was failing during SHAP analysis
3. **Error Handling:** Insufficient error reporting was making diagnosis difficult
4. **Worker Configuration:** Worker processes were not properly configured for Render

## Solution Implemented

The `shap_memory_fix.py` script implements several optimizations:

1. **Chunked Processing:** SHAP calculations are now done in batches to reduce peak memory usage
2. **Memory Monitoring:** Added `/admin/memory` endpoint for real-time monitoring
3. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Better error logging with memory usage information
4. **Garbage Collection:** Aggressive garbage collection to free memory during processing
5. **Worker Settings:** Improved worker configuration in `render.yaml`

## Verification

You can verify the fix is working with the included verification script:

```bash
# Set API key if needed
export API_KEY="your_api_key"

# Run verification
python verify_shap_fix.py
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be adjusted to tune performance:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| AGGRESSIVE_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT | true | Enables memory optimizations |
| SHAP_BATCH_SIZE | 500 | Maximum rows to process in a single batch |
| REDIS_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL | 30 | Seconds between Redis health checks |

## Monitoring

You can monitor memory usage of the service with:

```bash
curl http://your-service-url/admin/memory
```

This will return current memory usage and optimization status.
