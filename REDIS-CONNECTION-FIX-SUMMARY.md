# Redis Connection and Flask Context Fix - Summary

## Overview

This update addresses the "Working outside of application context" error that was occurring when deploying the SHAP microservice to Render. The error was caused by trying to register a Flask route for the Redis health check endpoint outside of a proper Flask application context.

## Changes Made

### 1. Flask Application Context Handling

- Modified `redis_connection_patch.py`:
  - Moved `register_redis_ping_endpoint` to be a top-level function
  - Removed direct use of `current_app` which was causing context errors
  - Updated `apply_all_patches()` to properly register endpoints

- Updated `app.py`:
  - Added proper Flask `app.app_context()` when initializing Redis
  - Stored Redis connection in `app.config['redis_conn']` for endpoint access
  - Added Redis connection status to the `/health` endpoint
  - Added a simple `/ping` endpoint that doesn't require context or auth

### 2. Redis Health Check Improvements

- Enhanced health checking:
  - The `/admin/redis_ping` endpoint now properly checks Redis connection
  - Added Redis connection status to the main `/health` endpoint
  - Created verification tools for testing Redis health

### 3. Testing and Verification

- Added new scripts:
  - `test_redis_context.py` - Test the Flask context fix locally
  - `verify_redis_endpoint.sh` - Verify Redis endpoint after deployment
  - `deploy_context_fix.sh` - Deploy and verify the fix

## How to Test

1. Deploy the fix:
```bash
./deploy_context_fix.sh
```

2. Verify the Redis health endpoint:
```bash
./verify_redis_endpoint.sh [service_url]
```

3. Check the service logs for any context errors (none should appear)

## Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- No more "Working outside of application context" errors in logs
- The `/admin/redis_ping` endpoint responds with Redis status
- The `/health` endpoint includes Redis connection information
- The `/ping` endpoint works regardless of Redis status

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
- Check the Render logs for any new errors
- Verify Redis connection credentials are correct
- Test locally with `test_redis_context.py`
